  ''' What do you do when you see something or someone who need a change in life?  Perhaps you think about it for a while and probably start looking for ways to help those in need. But you simply don't know where to start. We've been there too. And with that thought Crowd Works India Foundation were born. 
\t\t\tOne third of deaths around the world, around 18 million people a year or 50,000 per day are due to poverty-related causes. Among people in developing nations, women and children are affected by severe poverty. Our focus is on their well-being and rights in marginalized communities. We emphasise on promoting quality healthcare, comprehensive education, better living conditions and disaster preparedness and relief measures.  
\t\t\tA large number of people show lack of enthusiasm in making donations. We set out to find out why. The reason was quite simple. It wasn’t that people were not willing to help, they were just unsure whether their donations are going to the right people - the ones who needed it the most. We serve people by providing a trustworthy and legitimate platform to donate money to the needy people of society. Our overall goal is on alleviating poverty and social injustice. ''';
